## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `GreenboneAdminServiceApplication` class from your IDE.

- Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
- Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
- Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
- Open Eclipse
    - File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
    - Select the project
- Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
- Right click on the file and Run as Java Application

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```cmd
mvnw spring-boot:run
```
